# Filter-Sort API with Spring Boot and MongoDB ðŸŒŸ

## Overview

This Spring Boot application provides a robust API for filtering and sorting products stored in a MongoDB database. The API allows clients to retrieve products based on various criteria such as category, price range, and stock availability, and sort the results by price, rating, or creation date.

### Key Features

- **Flexible Filtering**: Filter products by category, price range, and stock availability.
- **Dynamic Sorting**: Sort products by price, rating, or creation date in ascending or descending order.
- **Exception Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid inputs and scenarios where no products are found.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests ensure the reliability and correctness of the filtering and sorting logic.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 11 or higher**: Ensure you have JDK 11 or a higher version installed.
- **Maven**: Make sure Maven is installed on your system.
- **MongoDB**: You should have a MongoDB instance running. You can use MongoDB Atlas or a local MongoDB instance.

### Running the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
2. **Update the application.properties file with your MongoDB URI:**
 `spring.application.name=Filter-SortApi`

`spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.ex9rztl.mongodb.net/yourDatabaseName?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`

Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and yourDatabaseName with your actual MongoDB credentials and database name.

4. **Fetching Products**

 GET "http://localhost:8080/products?category=electronics&minPrice=100&maxPrice=1000&inStock=true&sortField=price&sortOrder=asc"
